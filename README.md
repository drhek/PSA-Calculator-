Explanation for Doctors (Education):

Total PSA: The overall level of Prostate-Specific Antigen in the blood. Elevated levels can indicate prostate cancer, but also BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia), prostatitis, or recent manipulation. It's sensitive but not specific.

Free PSA: The portion of Total PSA that is not bound to proteins in the blood. Cancer cells tend to produce PSA that is more likely to be bound, while BPH tends to produce more free PSA.

PSA Ratio (% Free PSA):

Calculated as (Free PSA / Total PSA) * 100.

Purpose: Helps differentiate between BPH and prostate cancer, especially when Total PSA is in the intermediate range (e.g., 4-10 ng/mL, though useful outside this range too).

Interpretation: A higher percentage of free PSA (e.g., >25%) is more reassuring, suggesting BPH is more likely. A lower percentage (e.g., <15% or <10%) increases the suspicion for cancer.

Prostate Volume: The size of the prostate gland, typically measured in cubic centimeters (cc) or milliliters (mL) using ultrasound (TRUS or MRI).

PSA Density (PSAD):

Calculated as Total PSA / Prostate Volume.

Purpose: Adjusts the Total PSA level for the size of the prostate. A larger gland naturally produces more PSA, so a higher PSA might be less concerning in a very large gland if it's due to BPH.

Interpretation: A higher PSAD (e.g., >0.15 ng/mL/cc) suggests that the PSA level is disproportionately high for the gland size, increasing the suspicion for cancer, particularly clinically significant cancer. A lower PSAD is more reassuring.

Clinical Context is Crucial: Emphasize that these numbers are just tools. They must be interpreted alongside:

Patient's age and race.

Family history.

Digital Rectal Exam (DRE) findings.

PSA velocity (rate of change over time).

Previous biopsy results.

Imaging findings (MRI - PI-RADS score).

Patient symptoms and overall health.


This application provides a quick way to calculate these indices and offers a reminder of the general interpretation guidelines, serving as a useful educational aid. Remember the disclaimer!
